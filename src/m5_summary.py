# TODO: 2.
#   Write code that constructs a SimpleTurtle with a red Pen
#   and makes it move around a bit.  Don't forget to:
#     -- import rosegraphics and construct a TurtleWindow
#          at the BEGINNING of your code, and to
#     -- ask your TurtleWindow to   close_on_mouse_click
#          as the LAST line of your code.
#   See the beginning and end of m4e_loopy_turtles for an example.
#
#      ** Nothing fancy is required. **
#      ** The NEXT exercise will let you show your creativity. **
#
#   As always, test by running the module.
#
#   As always, COMMIT-and-PUSH when you are done with this module.
